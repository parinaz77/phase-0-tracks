          <li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
          Semantic tags do not make any changes to the apppierene of the website. they are mainly used for organaizing your html file and being able to create blocks of code that is easier later to add css formating to.

            Usually browser starts reading from top to bottom

          <li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
            snippets was a very helpful feature for future when I need to increase my speed in coding. at this time since I am trying to increase my speed in typing I prefer to write the codes everytime myself
          <li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
            the concept of understanding the orders of the elements and which element goes inside which was a bit challeneging to understand. It would help to review more codes that are using the oder to follow what goes where. looking at different examples will help with understanding the concept in dept.
