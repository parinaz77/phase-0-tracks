# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts .

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    * version control will record changes to the file and user can recall that version later. This will allow engineers to go back to the original code they wrote any time they wish. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    * branch will give a copy of the file to work on and keeps the master file unchanged. this will help to keep multile copies of the file and you can work on each separately. and when you are ready you can merge the branch with the master file to transfer the changes.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    * with commit, we will save changes to the repository. a good message is the one that will briefly explain the change that happened to the code. and if nesessatry why the changes was needed
* What is a merge conflict?
    * merge conflict at git happenes when 2 people are trying to merge branches to the master file and both persons have modified the same line differently. in this case git wont know which branch is right and which one is wrong. thats why git will mark the file as merge conflict and you have to solve the issue.
